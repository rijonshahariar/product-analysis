                <h4>1. How React Works?</h4>
                <p>React implements a virtual DOM that is basically a DOM tree representation in JavaScript. So when it needs to read or write to the DOM, it will use the virtual representation of it. Then the virtual DOM will try to find the most efficient way to update the browserâ€™s DOM. Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.</p>
                <h4>2. Difference Between Props and UseState?</h4>
                <p> <strong>Props</strong><br />
                    1. Props are read-only. <br />
                    2. Props are immutable. <br />
                    3. Props are used to communicate between components.<br />
                    4. Props can be accessed by the child component.  <br />
                    5. Props make components reusable. <br /> <br />
                    <strong>State</strong><br />
                    1. State changes can be asynchronous. <br />
                    2. State is mutable. <br />
                    3. State holds information about the components. <br />
                    4. State cannot be accessed by child components. <br />
                    5. Stateless components cannot have State.</p>
                <h4>3. How useState Works?</h4>
                <p>useState is a React Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components. You have to pass the initial state to this function and it returns a variable with the current state value and another function to update this value. useState should be used only inside functional components. useState is the way if we need an internal state.</p>
